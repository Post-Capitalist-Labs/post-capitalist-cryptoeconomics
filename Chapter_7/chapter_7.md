# Chapter 7: Post-Capitalist Critique of Cryptoeconomic Incentives in Public Goods Funding

In the blockchain ecosystem, the cryptoeconomic incentives driving public goods funding, public utilities, and retroactive public good funding are not immune to criticism from a post-capitalist perspective. While these mechanisms aim to promote collective benefits, certain issues and unintended consequences merit scrutiny.

## 1. Public Goods Funding

### Positive Aspects:
- **Cryptoeconomic Incentive:** Various blockchain ecosystems allocate funds to support public goods, fostering the development of open-source projects, infrastructure, and community-driven initiatives.
- **Examples:** Gitcoin Grants in Ethereum, where users can contribute to public goods funding rounds, supporting projects that enhance the overall ecosystem.

### Critique:
- **Potential for Inequality:** Despite good intentions, public goods funding often relies on voluntary contributions, leading to potential imbalances where well-known projects or influential individuals receive more support than lesser-known but equally valuable initiatives.

## 2. Public Utilities

### Positive Aspects:
- **Cryptoeconomic Incentive:** Blockchain networks often provide public utilities, such as decentralized storage and computation, aiming to create a shared infrastructure for all users.
- **Examples:** Filecoin for decentralized storage, and Ethereum for decentralized computation.

### Critique:
- **Access and Inclusivity:** While providing public utilities, the accessibility of these services may be hindered by factors like technological literacy, creating a potential digital divide that contradicts the post-capitalist emphasis on inclusivity.

## 3. Retroactive Public Good Funding

### Positive Aspects:
- **Cryptoeconomic Incentive:** Some blockchain projects implement retroactive funding models, rewarding contributors based on past contributions to
