# Chapter 0: Rethinking Cryptoeconomics: Moving Beyond Profit Maximization

Cryptoeconomics, the fusion of game theory, cryptographic proofs, and computer science to shape future economic outcomes, is a cornerstone of major blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the predominant use of cryptoeconomics today leans heavily on assumptions rooted in profit-maximizing individualism, which may not align with the broader goals of creating sustainable and equitable decentralized systems.

## Cryptoeconomics in Practice

Cryptoeconomics has been instrumental in conceptualizing and designing blockchain protocols. From fault tolerance considerations, exemplified by the 'Byzantine Generals Problem,' to incentivizing participation through mechanisms like proof-of-work mining and proof-of-stake validation, the field has played a crucial role in ensuring the security and stability of decentralized networks.

However, the existing cryptoeconomic paradigm relies on the assumption that individuals are rational actors driven solely by self-interest. This assumption shapes protocols, such as staking 32 ETH to become a validator with the expectation of rewards, creating a system where self-interest becomes the invisible hand guiding user behavior.

## Unintended Consequences and Adverse Effects

The profit-maximizing approach inherent in current cryptoeconomics has led to unintended consequences. In trading crypto pairs, for instance, the pursuit of personal gain can result in market distortions, fostering opportunities for arbitrage and frontrunning. The Flashbots team's revelation of ~$900 million MEV exploitation in 2021 underscores the impact of these strategies on network and community well-being.

Moreover, 'token economics,' a form of cryptoeconomics abstracting away protocol considerations, has driven a desire to tokenize everything. This trend risks leaving the development of distributed ledger technologies and decentralized consensus protocols solely in the hands of self-interest and profit maximization.

## A Call for Post-Capitalist Cryptoeconomics

Recognizing the biases introduced by profit-maximizing assumptions in cryptoeconomics, there is a need for an alternative paradigm. The current model aligns with a capitalist mindset where individual self-interest prevails, often exacerbating societal inequalities.

A post-capitalist cryptoeconomics envisions a shift towards values that prioritize the well-being of the less fortunate and aim to minimize socio-economic gaps. The goal is to incentivize a society that embraces solidarity, equality, self-management, direct democracy, and diversity.

This alternative approach rejects the notion of 'programming people' through game theory, acknowledging the inadequacy of the 'homo economicus' assumption prevalent in today's cryptoeconomics. Instead, it seeks to leverage game theory, cryptography, and computer science to gently and non-deterministically promote values that foster a more just and equitable society.

In conclusion, as we navigate the evolving landscape of cryptoeconomics, a post-capitalist perspective urges a reevaluation of assumptions and values. By challenging the current profit-maximizing narrative, we can strive to build decentralized systems that prioritize the collective well-being and diversity of participants over individual gains.
