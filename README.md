# An anti-capitialist cryptoeconomics

This project is about theorizing an anti-capitalist cryptoeconomic theory as an alternative approach to the cryptoeconomics shaping the blockchain ecosystem today.

##The problem

Cryptoeconomics is the use of game theory, cryptographic proofs and computer science to guarantee future economic outcomes. Most of the top protocols in the blockchain ecosystem, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, apply cryptoeconomics, for example in describing the fault tolerance of a protocol through the ['Byzantine Generals Problem'](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf), which is a [coordination game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game) problem, but also when incentivising the systems, such as proof-of-work mining rewards, proof-of-stake validator rewards, and making it very costly to perform attacks against the networks, eg 51% attacks. 

The problem with cryptoeconomics today is that it has been used to theorize protocol development and user experiences in ways that assume that people are profit maximizing individualists and that, by seeking their own self-interest, this behavior is rational. For example, an individual stakes 35 ETH to become a validator, and there are validator rewards -- which is why anyone would become a validator -- and they are expected to behave accordingly (eg not maliciously) otherwise they face penalties and their ETH is slashed. In this cryptoeconomics, self-interest is the invisible hand that makes everyone behave according to the rules of the game, but there are adverse effects. For example, when trading crypto pairs it is natural to buy cheap and sell dear for as low as personal risk as possible. This helps enable perverse market incentives where opportunities for [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) and [frontrunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running) occur at the expense of the rest of network and community wellbeing. For example, the Flashbots team revealed that 'maximum extracted value'(MEV) accounted for [~900 million USD in 2021](https://explore.flashbots.net/) through exploiting MEV frontrunning, arbitrage and other strategies. Additionally, 'token economics', which is form of cryptoeconomics which abstracts away protocol considerations, is driven by the desire to tokenize everything. Distributed ledger technologies and decentralized consensys protocols are too important for people and planet to leave to the interests of self-interest and profit-maximization. A intervention is needed to promote an laternative so that protocls and applicaitons can be built which promote better values.

That the assumptions underlying today's cryptoeconomics have biased the evolution of distributed ledger technology and decentralized consensus protocols towards self-interest and profit-maximization is no surprise. This is consistent in a society based on capitalism and markets where buyers and sellers fleece one another to gain wealth and power while the vast majority struggle to survive. The profit maximizing individualist, today's proponent of cryptoeconomics, might roll their eyes before countering that the individual's struggle for personal wealth has reduced poverty overall and so profit maximization has done more good than harm. This is a basic liberal view consistent with social contract theory. For example, John Rawls' theory of justice envisioned a just outcome being one that raised the position of those least well off in society to one that is better. He did so through a ['veil of ignorance' thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position) where an individual is asked to imagine the principles they would use to guide a basic structure of society, without knowing ahead of time what position they would hold in that society. The choice is made behind a 'veil of ignorance' which prevents them from knowing their own race, class, gender, ability or decision-making status and also without knowing anyone else's.The idea was for an individual to imagine guiding principles for a just society. But this is not enough. That's because in Rawls' formulation you can both improve the position of those least well off in society and -- at the same time -- increase the gap between the rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless, etc. and that is why self-seeking profit maximization is a poor argument for making societies more equal. 

The goal of a new anti-capitalist cryptoeconomics is to increase the wellbeing of those less well off and minimize the gap between rich and poor, the powerful and powerless, incentivised overall to drive society towards solidarity, classlessness, self-managing, directly-democratic and diverse outcomes. The anti-capitalist cryptoeconomics spelled out here does not believe you can use game theory to ['program people'(link qoute) or their behavior. That is because this theory abandons the outdated assumption that people are ['homo economicus'](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/samuel-bowles-death-homo-economicus/2017/03/21), the profit-maximizing individualist that haunts the crypto scene today. Instead, this effort aims to apply game theory, cryptography and computer science to promote those values, however gently and non-deterministically, with an understanding that we cannot force people to behave the way we want to.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
