# An anti-capitialist cryptoeconomics

An alternative to current cryptoeconomic theories shaping the blockchain ecosystem, to provide a new framework for decentralized consensus protocols that promote solidarity, self-management, diversity, classlessness and direct democracy.


#The problem

Cryptoeconomics is the use of game theory, cryptographic proofs and computer science to guarantee future economic outcomes. Most of the top protocols in the blockchain ecosystem, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, apply cryptoecononmcis, for exmaple in describing the fault tolerance of a protocol through the 'Byzantine General's Problem', which is a cooordaintion problem, but also when incentivising the systems, such as proof-of-work mining rewards, proof-of-stake validator rewards, and making it very costly to perform attacks against the networks, eg 51% attacks. The problem with cryptoeconomics today is that it has been used to theorise protocol development and user expeiences in ways that assume that people are profit maximising individualists and that, by seeking their own self-interest, this behavior is rational. For example, an individual stakes 35 ETH to become a validator, and there are validator rewards and penalties. Trading crypto pairs is all about buying cheap and selling dear for as low as personal risk as possible. This helps enable perverse market incentives where opportunities for arbitrage and frontrunning occurs at the expense of the rest of the network and community. For example, the Flashbots team revealed that 'maximum extracted value'(MEV) accounted for ~900 million USD in 2021 through exploiting MEV opportunities (https://explore.flashbots.net/). Additionally, 'token economics', which is form of cryptoeconomics which abstracts away protocol considerations, is driven by the desire to tokeniz everything. The assumptions underlaying todya's cryptoeconomics has biased the development of distributed ledger technology and decentralized consensus protocols. 

This work is an effort to create a new alternative cryptoeconomics that uses game theory, gametheory and computor science in a way that biases towards social and individual outcomes on equal footing to enable values such as solidarity, direct democracy, diversity, self-management and classlessness. For example, John Rawls' theory of justice envisioned a just outcome being one that raised the position of those least well off in society to one that is better and he did so through a 'viel of 'ignorance' thought experient considering where and individual is asked to imagine the principles they would use to guide a basic structure of society, without knowing ahead of time what position they would hold in that society. The choice is made behind a "veil of ignorance" which prevents them from knowing their race, class, gender, ability or decision-makinkg status or knowing anyone elses. But this is not enough. That's because the experiemnt should be conductred, not onnly from an individual perspective, but a collective perspective becuase in Rawls' formulation you can both improve the position of those least well off in society AND, at the same time, increase the gap between the rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless, etc. The goal of a new anti-captialist cryptoeconommcs is to increase those less well off AND minimize the gap between rich and poor, the powerful and powerless, incentivised overall to drive towards soldarity, classlessness, self-management, direct-demiocracy. 

Another important difference between anti-captialist cryptoeconomics spelled out here and the dominant cryptoeconomics is that this effort doe snot beleive you can use game theory to 'program people' (link to quote) or their behavior. that is becuase this theory abandons the out dated assumption that people are 'homo economicus' that haunts the crypto scene today. Instead, this effort aimes to apply game thoery, cryptogrpahy and computor science to gently guid and promote human values such as those above, and others, with an understanding that we cannot force people to behave the way we want to.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
